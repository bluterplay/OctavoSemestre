the others the world stands on the brink of apocalypse as the fanatics of the hell club have summoned the 7 deadly sins to lay waste to our reality slowly the others have creeped into our lives corrupting society from within the city of haven is the key to their invasion but it will not go down without a fight thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as faith federal authority for the interdiction of transdimensional horrors each session of the others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single sin against the other players who control a team of 7 faith heroes the heroes cooperate to survive the sins attacks and accomplish the missions set before them while the sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways preferably by destroying them the heroes are divided into different classes each specialized in a different aspect of the game leaders are good at helping the other members of the team bruisers are excellent melee fighters snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance and fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to faithrsquos victory corruption is one of the main mechanics of the game it is both a way for the sin to consume heroes and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldnrsquot be capable of normally taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses as long as they keep taking corruption but when they become fully corrupted their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences the sins player on the other hand has access to the different monsters of each sin including abominations a controller and the terrifying avatar of sin these monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes or simply hinder their progress on their missions each sin provides the sins player with a different deck of sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects often tied to the strategy of each sin yes because each sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect for example pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own while sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each sin which will always stand between them and their mission the sins are also aided by acolytes with each session using a different type these lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives for example corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing there are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of the others each of them brings different special rules different dynamics and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious there are terror stories which are more straightforward focusing on action and combat corruption stories revolve around the corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves and redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain each story can be played on a different map setup which further makes the dynamic of each session unique the board used in the others is made up of several tiles each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets as the city of haven still belongs to humanity and itrsquos the sins that are attempting to take it over the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them for example they can go to the hospital to heal wounds to the museum to get rid of corruption to the ravencorp tower to get new equipment or to the police station to call in an orbital strike what districts are available on each map and their location can greatly change the dynamic of the game as the game progresses and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments the apocalypse track will advance making the sins gradually stronger and more terrifying apocalypse cards tied to the type of story being played terror corruption or redemption introduce new twists and challenges to the game even bringing in the members of the hell club themselves heroes will die either in noble sacrifice torn apart by claws and tentacles or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls the question is whether the faith team will manage to fulfill their final mission in time or whether the sins will reign supreme over humanity mdashdescription

traders of carthage players are merchants who are attempting to ship four different types of goods from alexandria to carthage players affect how quickly or slowly the ships move and can trigger pirate raids that may cost their opponents their goods traders of osaka moves the gameplay to a new continent and era with players now trying to deliver cargo from osaka to edo but otherwise gameplay remains the same the game has a small board that shows the route the ships will follow marking safe ports and dangerous waters the board also has two spaces for the draw pile and discard pile and shows where the market and farm cards are laid out the game also contains a deck of cards that have multiple uses 48 achievement tokens for when goods are sold four ship pieces to mark how far the ships have sailed four trader pieces to indicate a players scoring pile four reservation pieces for players to mark cards they wish to purchase or take on a later round and a rulebook the game is a set collection game at its core players are attempting to collect sets of goods that will allow them to collect cards that will be worth points at the end of the game during the game the cards can be used to represent goods when laid out in front of players to represent gold to purchase goods when played from their hands or urns which players will use to protect goods from pirates deciding how to use the cards and when is the basis of playing the game on a players turn they can do one of three things buy goods get coins or reserve a card buying goods has the player buying cards from the market there will be a number of cards laid out face up in the market each card has a gold value in the corners and indicates how much a card is worth either 2 3 or 5 when a player buys goods they must buy all the cards in the market using cards in hand to pay if a player cannot afford the whole market they cannot do this action any cards purchased this way are laid out face up in front of the player these goods are now aboard the ship of the matching color then the player moves each matching ship either 1 or 2 spaces towards carthage 1 space if 1 card of that color was purchased 2 spaces if 2 or more cards were purchased if a ship moves onto carthage a payout occurs and pirates attack this will be explained in detail later if the market is bought out or if the current player cant take or buy market cards due to reservation pieces the cards in the farm 3 face up cards are moved to the market 2 cards are drawn from the draw pile and are added to the market then 3 new cards are drawn for the farm and are placed face up getting coins has the player taking a single card from the market and placing it in his hand that card is now money its value indicated by the gold value in the corners this is the only way players can increase the amount of money they have reserving a card has the player placing their reservation piece on a card in the market or in the farm this card is now unavailable to all other players the reservation piece is now committed to that card and cant be taken back until the owning player acquires the reserved card either as money or as a good the owning player may take the card on his next turn or leave it assuming there is another legal play he can do after taking his turn the next player takes his action and so on until the game ends if a payout occurs each player that has goods on that ship takes part first the players count how many of that colored good they have then they look at the value of the goods and determine which has the highest value they take that value and multiply it by the number of cards in the set rounding up to the nearest 5 or 10 for example if a player has 3 yellow goods and the highest value is 3 they would multiply 3 by 3 to get 9 then round up to 10 the player then takes that value and divides by 5 the result indicates how many cards of that set the player keeps keeping with the example the player would divide 10 by 5 to get a result of 2 this means the player keeps 2 out of the 3 cards from the set players keep the lowest valued card first and work their way up until they have the reached their limit these cards are placed face down near the players with their trader piece on the pile indicating this is their scoring pile at the end of the game each card in the scoring pile is worth 1 point this procedure is completed for each ship that reached carthage then those ships are moved back to alexandria ready for another voyage each player that had a payout then takes 1 achievement token for each color they scored not each card they scored when during a payout any player that scores and has matching achievement tokens to the scored goods will add the amount of tokens they have to the highest value card in the set they then figure out how many cards they keep for example if a player has 3 blue cards with the highest value being 5 the player also has two blue tokens the player would add 2 for his tokens to 5 for a value of 7 then he would multiply 7 by 3 getting 21 and round up to 25 after dividing 25 by 5 the player can keep 5 cards if a player gets to keep more cards than in the set as in this example they keep the entire set and draw cards from the top of the draw pile to make up the difference these drawn cards are kept face down and are added to the score pile after the payout any ships that are in the two pirate spaces are attacked affected players may now discards cards from their hand to protect their goods on those ships each card has either 2 1 or no urns on them when you discard a card with 2 urns two goods of that color are protected from the pirates for example if a player has 2 blue goods and discards a blue card with 2 urns then he may choose which two cards are protected after all players have finished discarding cards which is voluntary players are not required to protect their goods the attacked ships are moved back to the nearest safe port and may move again towards carthage the game ends once a player has 8 or more achievement tokens the winner is the player with the highest score number of cards in their score pile if there is a tie the tiebreaker is the number of achievement tokens the tied players have if there is still a tie then the game ends in a tie

gmt website empire of the sun eots is mark hermans third card driven design since he introduced the system to the hobby in we the people eots is a strategic level look at the entire war in the pacific from the attack on pearl harbor until the surrender of japan eots is the first card driven game cdg to move the system closer to a classic hexagon wargame while retaining all of the tension and uncertainty people have come to expect from a cdg players are cast in the role of macarthur yamamoto nimitz and mountbatten as you direct your forces across the breadth of the globe from india to hawaii and from alaska to australia this is represented on a single map based on a 1942 equal area projection of the entire theater of conflict as in other games using the cdg system players try to maximize the impact of their cards even as they hide their intentions and traps from their opponent the player is faced with a wide set of clear strategic choices the focus of eots is on directing major offensive axes of advance the japanese early in the game are challenged to achieve their historical expansion as allied forces battle the clock to react with their inplace forces trying to achieve maximum damage to the hardtoreplace japanese veteran units combat in eots is based on successfully bringing superior combined land air and sea forces to bear in a twotiered combat system the first tier is the resolution of airnaval combat the second tier covers ground combat the culmination of both tiers results in one side prevailing in battle the key variable in determining strategic victory is the level of us political will the japanese win the game by forcing the us into a negotiated peace which was not achieved historically the japanese achieve this by knocking countries like india china and australia out of the war while inflicting massive casualties on the united states the delivery of the abomb on its historical schedule is not a guarantee often necessitating operation olympic and the invasion of japan it is often in its darkest hour that the japanese find victory in eots eots scenarios were designed with the busy enthusiast grognard and competitive tournament player in mind eots was designed to be played n yearly scenarios 1942 1943 and 1944 of three turns each that play in under two hours if you are a fan of cdgs eots takes the genre into a familiar but new direction if you are a fan of classic hexagon wargames this game has all of the features that brought you to this hobby in the first place but with a new level of excitement and replayability the game is comprehensive but easy to learn time scale 4 months per turn map scale 150 miles per hex unit scale brigade division corps and army designer mark herman developer stephen newberg map amp card art mark simonitch counter art mark simonitch dave lawrence amp rodger b macgowan from the designer empire of the sun eots uses a variant of my card driven system the game has one map that covers the pacific theater of operations from india to hawaii and from the aleutians to australia eots is the first card driven game to use hexes which facilitates calculating movement and aircraft ranges each game turn covers 4 months three turns per year with a special december 41 special two card game turn for a total of 12 game turns for the campaign the game is at the strategic level using naval units built around a capital ship class eg cv wasp bb washington etc air units at the air force air flotilla air division level and most ground units are corps armies although there are a host of specialized units at the division and below level the game has 165 cards divided into an allied and a japanese deck the game uses a two tiered combat system with airnaval combat preceding ground combat the system has players roll for combat efficiency which is a strength multiplier from 5 to 2 this value multiplied by the unit strengths is the number of hits the enemy takes in combat with some special conditions based on number of cvs present and the like as far as game play is concerned china is abstracted using a track whereby the play of certain events and chinese offensives puts pressure on the allies to support this theater with resources or see it fall and hurt allied morale this is balanced against the fact that japanese land replacements come from this theater so the more they draw it down for conflict in other locations the more likely china will survive northern india and burma are active theaters of operation where the majority of the continuous ground warfare in the game occurs if the japanese can successfully occupy northern india they can drive this nation and its commonwealth units out of the war australia can also be knocked out of the war although it is hard to keep it out permanently then of course there is the famous island campaigns with the us driving across the pacific to knock japan out of the war
